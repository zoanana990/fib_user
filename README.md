# fib_user

Here are two method to calculate fibonacci number
one is iteration and the other is fast doubling.

Code in this project aims to insert in kernel module, 
thus there are almost no standard library function, 
except printf and malloc...

Therefore, some basic function needs to rewrite, 
for example: `strlen`, `strcopy` and big number structure...
